# Styles

Styles for this library was written on SCSS. It's recomended to use initial SCSS files for any customization purposes. To do this, perform actions below:
* Dowload [styles](https://github.com/f3oall/awesome-notifications/tree/master/src/styles) folder
* Edit [variables.scss](https://github.com/f3oall/awesome-notifications/tree/master/src/styles/variables.scss) or any other file you want
* Compile your SCSS to CSS
* Upload resulted CSS to your project

Also, you can just use default `style.css`, but override it in your styles file. To learn more about default styles,
look at  [styles](https://github.com/f3oall/awesome-notifications/tree/master/src/styles) folder.
